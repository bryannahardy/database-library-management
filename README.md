# database-library-management
This repository contains a project from my Database Systems class in Spring 2021.

This project is about creating a database from scratch. For this class project, we got to choose what database we wanted to create, I chose to create a Library Management database to help store information about the consumers, branches, and so on. In this repository, it will contain the files that I have created in MySQL and also my final report with everything summarized. Enjoy!
